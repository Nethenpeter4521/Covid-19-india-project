Conclusion
1. We saw in the above analysis of COVID-19  that initially more and more cases were coming every day, however, a long lockdown in the year 2020 helped contain the disease to some extent.

2. With the coming of a new variant in the second wave, there was again an upsurge for a few months in the total cases per day.

3. Finally with the vaccination drive and more people getting vaccinated the active cases started coming down Aug onward in the year 2021.
